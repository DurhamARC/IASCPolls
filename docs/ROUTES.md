# IASC API Routes

Functional routes which return a response all provide JSON Objects to the React frontend.

Functional routes which take parameters can acquire these through the `GET` request parameters (e.g. `GET /api/survey?page=1&size=10`), or within the `POST` body where this is specified. `POST` body parameters should be formatted as JSON. Lists provided to single `GET` HTTP parameters should be separated by semicolons (;). 

The icon ‚ö†Ô∏è indicates that the routes in the given group require login to request on. This involves the browser passing the correct session cookie. Unauthenticated route requests will return `HTTP 401 Unauthorized`.

All requests to these protected routes should include the CSRF token which is set as a cookie by the `/login` route. This can be via setting the Request header `X-CSRFToken` or including `csrfmiddlewaretoken` in the `POST` body.

# Login
`POST /login/`  
Get a session ID that an administrator will send as a cookie in subsequent requests to access the back-end. The `POST` body should contain the following:

```javascript
username="admin"
password="mypassword"
```

On a successful login, the server will return `302 Found` and redirect to the admin page.

## Logout
`GET /logout/`
Log the user out of the application, invalidating the session cookie from the `/login` route. The server will return a `302 Found` redirect to the `/` index of the web application.

```javascript
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "File uploaded"
}
```

The expectation is that the sheet will be formatted as follows, with example data provided. 
Non-compliant sheets will be rejected with `Failure` status and an error message.

      "kind": "LI",
      "active": "True",
      "expiry": "2023-05-01T12:34:56.789Z",
