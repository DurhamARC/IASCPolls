                        <p>We aim to set up a hub-and-spoke, international network provisionally titled ‘The Institute for Ascertaining Scientific Consensus’ (IASC). IASC will be capable of emailing >100,000 scientists, asking for an agree/disagree response regarding a specific statement of interest, a candidate scientific fact such as ‘Covid is caused by a virus’. Emails will be sent internally within each participating institution, by a spoke representative, and the time-demand to read the email and respond will be less than two minutes. In this way the response rate will be very high, compared with the usual scientific opinion surveys. The responses will be instantly and anonymously recorded in a database, and the strength of consensus calculated. The network will be humanity’s premier means for measuring strength of scientific consensus regarding a specific statement of interest. It will thus stand as a useful tool for policymakers, especially given the proven[1] ability of consensus announcements to influence opinions and actions. It will also serve to inform laypersons, fighting against ‘fake news’ and misinformation. In other cases, it will serve to illuminate where experts in different countries, or different parts of the world, see things differently.</p>

                    <h2>Method, including advantages over currently available state-of-the-art methodologies</h2>
                        <p>The vast majority of methodologies currently being used to survey scientists fail to meet any of the following three criteria, all of which will be met by the new method:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            Emails are individual and personal.</li>
                            <li>
                            Emails are sent from somebody internal to each scientist’s own institution.</li>
                            <li>
                            Overall time-demand is only a couple of minutes: emails are very concise, and the participant responds with two clicks.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In a pre-pilot-project (June 2022) scientists at Durham, UK, were provided with a statement, and merely asked to choose between two options ‘A’ and ‘B’; many responded with nothing more than a letter, either ‘A’ or ‘B’. In the proposed pilot project, scientists will be able to simply click a button (‘agree’ or ‘disagree’) embedded within the email. Their (totally anonymous) answer will be automatically recorded in a database.</p>

                        <p>Brief comparisons with state-of-the-art methodologies for surveying scientists’ opinions are here considered. First, in the well-known Myers et al (2021) paper reporting a solid consensus on the question of anthropogenic global warming, an 8-page questionnaire was sent to 10,929 scientists, and 2,780 responses were eventually received – a return rate of 25%. To achieve this return rate, three reminder emails were sent. The timeline between sending out the questionnaire and analysing the results was 36 days: 10th September to 16th October 2019. Whilst this methodology is effective up to a point, it is slow, and the slow return rate is a barrier to a significant scale-up. Sending personal, ‘internal’ emails to individual scientists, asking a simple ‘agree or disagree’ question, ensures a much higher return rate, and could in principle be scaled up to quickly access the opinions of many tens of thousands of scientists.</p>

                        <p>Second, in the Work and Well-Being Survey (Vaidyanathan 2021), out of 22,840 scientists contacted only 3,442 replied, which is a return rate of 15%. To get even that return rate required three months, during which time 13 reminder emails were sent (across two waves of solicitation) as well as reminder snail-mail postcards, and incentives were offered such as gift cards and a raffle to win an iPad.</p>

                        <p>The new methodology envisioned in this pilot project is quicker, simpler, more repeatable, and has the potential to pool a far greater number of opinions. In the pre-pilot-study Vickers achieved a 62% return rate based on nothing more than one email, indicating that with even just one or two reminder emails a very high return rate (>75%) might well be achieved.</p>




                    <h2>Objections and replies</h2>
                    <p>A few possible objections to the proposed programme, and initial responses, are as follows:</p>

                    <h3>The programme will only appeal to ‘realists’, who are predisposed to accept that science delivers truths/facts about our world. But there are many non-realists, who would reject this.</h3>
                    <p>The so-called ‘scientific realism/antirealism debate’ concerns knowledge of unobservables. In fact, nearly all non-realists do accept that there are many established scientific facts. There exists a philosophical consensus that many scientific facts can be identified, including (for example) ‘smoking causes cancer’. This issue is discussed at length in Chapters 1 and 2 of my new monograph, Identifying Future-Proof Science (OUP 2022).</p>

                    <h3>Many scholars reject the link between consensus and truth</h3>
                    <p>First: There are different kinds, and strengths, of ‘consensus’. Few scholars would dispute that truth can be accessed via an absolutely solid scientific consensus (>95%), achieved via bona fide scientific activity, in a large, international, diverse scientific community. This issue is discussed at length in Identifying Future-Proof Science.</p>
                    <p>Second: Undoubtedly, it is sometimes important to quantify scientific opinion. Thus the project developed here may be viewed as an important methodological experiment, even if one rejects any connection between ‘consensus’ and ‘truth’.</p>

                    <h3>Targeted scientists would soon become fatigued, and the process would collapse</h3>
                    <p>The network would constantly be shifting. Fatigue at an institution in the network would be monitored via the return rate of the institution, and spokes would sometimes drop out. But new spokes in the network would perpetually be added.</p>

                    <h3>Often, the pool of ‘relevant scientists’ would be very small</h3>
                    <p>Precisely how ‘relevant scientists’ would be selected is something that would be worked out as the project developed. Initially, the plan would be to select scientists by departmental affiliation, ruling out departments that are quite obviously not sufficiently relevant. Thus, for a question about anthropogenic global warming, it would not be unreasonable to leave out Mathematics and Psychology departments. The basic idea is to ask all ‘relevant scientists’, broadly construed. For any given statement to be tested, the issue of ‘relevant scientists’ would be debated within the network and Advisory Board. A high priority would be to give no impression whatsoever of cherry-picking experts. So, for example, for a statement about climate change, we would not merely invite climate change experts.</p>
                    <p>B. If the relevant pool of scientists really was extremely small, then the results would (probably) fail to be reliable. This would (probably) be a limitation of the approach: it could only be applied reliably to some scientific statements.</p>

                    <h3>Any ‘Institute for Scientific Consensus’ wouldn’t influence the public very much</h3>
                    <p>Research shows that consensus announcements have great power to influence; e.g. Bartoš et al. (2022), ‘Communicating doctors’ consensus persistently increases COVID-19 vaccinations’, Nature, Vol. 606.</p>

                    <p>[1] Bartoš et al. (2022): Communicating doctors’ consensus persistently increases COVID-19 vaccinations. Nature, Vol. 606.</p>
