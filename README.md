## Background

Humanity needs a way to pool scientific community opinion quickly and efficiently on a given statement of interest.
This should be on a very large scale, such that one can have confidence that the result reflects international 
scientific opinion. For this pilot project (2022-23) Peter Vickers has built a network of 30+ academic institutions
around the world. Personal, one-to-one emails are to be sent locally to all relevant scientists at those institutions, 
asking for a yes/no answer to a given question. The scientist answers by hitting a button embedded in the email, and 
confirming the response in a second step. Each scientist on our list should have one vote only, and nobody else gets 
to vote. Voting should be anonymous, with any 'token' linking the scientist to his/her vote being destroyed after 
voting. Votes should be tagged to academic department, and institution, for subsequent data analysis. Originally the 
project was set up with Word, Excel, and Microsoft Forms, but several problems were encountered; tailored architecture 
is needed.


## Getting Started

This project is developed in [Python Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

[//]: # ### Docker

[//]: # ### Running Locally

[//]: # The [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file in the root of this repository includes the project dependencies and can be run to set up an instant working development system. For manual setup instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

[//]: # ### Deployment

[//]: # A couple of different production deployment possibilities are documented in [PRODUCTION.md](PRODUCTION.md). We include a production [docker-compose](docker-compose.production.yml) file for running the system behind a [Tr√¶fik](https://traefik.io/traefik) load balancer.

## Contributing

Please feel free to comment on and create [issues](issues). When creating an issue, please use the correct issue template, e.g. for Bug Reports or Feature Requests.

### `main` Branch
Protected and should only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### `devel` Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### `feature` Branches
Feature branches should be created from the `main` and `devel` branches to track commits per feature being worked on. External developers should fork the repository and add their commits to a Pull Request. This follows the ["github-flow" model of branching](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

### `release` Branch
Pushing to the `release` branch triggers the CI/CD workflow to build the Docker images and upload them to the [DurhamARC DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/durhamarc/) repositories, then release to Azure and the backend servers. The release branch is protected and can only be pushed to by authorized members (currently [@sjmf](https://github.com/sjmf) and [@Abel-Durham](https://github.com/Abel-Durham)).

The release branch is managed by rebasing on top of the `main` branch and creating a tag. For example:

```shell
$ git checkout release
$ git rebase main
$ git tag -a v1.x -m "Release v1.x"
$ git push origin release v1.x
$ git checkout main
```


## Built With

We are using the following frameworks and tools to develop this software:

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Docker](https://docker.io/)

A CI/CD pipeline is used to test and release this software, using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/devops/pipelines/).
